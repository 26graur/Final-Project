        <p>Pax pauses, letting Bane talk. He quickly starts explaining the plan he came up with. He 
                says how he has a plan with a half demon he met to save everyone. She shakes her 
                head, asking why he would want to escape. Bane takes a deep breath and asks if she 
                really wants to die in here like her parents. Pax freezes, asking what he means. Bane 
                tells her he overheard Teric talking about how he ensured her parents died in the 
                arena before she hatched, then lied to her about what happened.
        </p>

        <p>Pax turns away, furous. She raises her gaze to the box where Teric sits, watching the 
                fight.
