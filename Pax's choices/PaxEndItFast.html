        <p>Pax dodged around the lion hybrid, slashing her trident through the air and disarming the 
                lion hybrid. She drives him back against the wall, stabbing her trident down.
        </p>

        <h3>15 Years Later</h3>
        <p>Pax just got out of a major fight when Bane suddenly comes running into their room. He's 
                out of breath, panting. He starts ranting, trying to explain something big, but before 
                he can say more than a few words Teric comes in. He orders Bane taken to a differant 
                room, say that the two of them will fight in the morning.
        </p>

        <p>The next morning Pax walks out into the arena, looking around, Bane is at the opposite 
                end of the arena. They lock eyes and he starts walking towards her. Pax raises 
                her trident at him. He stops, looking down at her.
