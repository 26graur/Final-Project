        <p>Pax headed back to her room, curling up to take a nap. She woke up with a start when Teric 
            came storming in. He was furious, asking what she thought she was doing in here when 
            she was supposed to be training.
        </p>

        <p>Pax mumbled that she was sleepy. Teric glared at her, saying that if she had times to 
            take a nap that she must be trained enough for the arena. She paled in fear as he grabbed 
            her arm, dragging her out into the arena. Her opponent is a massive lion hybrid
        </p>

        <p>The lion charged at her, his ax swinging.
