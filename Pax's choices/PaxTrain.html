        <p>Pax nodded, heading towards the training rooms. She jabs her trident at the dummies, 
            practicing her strikes.

        <h3>2 Years Later</h3>
        <p>Pax was sitting in her room when Teric had another dragonborn brought in, this one 
            a male with black scales. She glared at him, seeing him as nothing but a threat to 
            her position as the arena champion. He swallowed nervously, introducing himself as 
            Bane. 
        </p>

        <p>Teric calls Pax over, telling her to get ready for her fight. Pax walked out into the 
                arena, facing off against a lion hybrid.
