        <div class="Description">
        <p>Bane stands up, following the smoke smell. He looks around, checking under furniture and 
                around cabinets. He walks over to the cooking fire and freezes. The fire is lit, but it's 
                not the usual clean blaze his mother uses to cook. It's pouring out black smoke, the house 
                quickly filling with the noxious fumes.
        </p>

        <p>Bane runs out of the cottage, coughing. He looks up at his burning house. Then he turns and 
                runs, pushing branches out of the way. After hours of running he stumbles into a town. 
                People ignore him, stepping around him as if he were an inanimate inconvinence. He 
                fights back tears, slumping down in an allyway.
        </p>

        <p>Suddenly Bane feels hands grab his arms. He struggles but the hands just tighten on him. 
                He feels course rope being wrapped around his wrists, tying his hands behind his back.
                He's hauled into a wagon.
