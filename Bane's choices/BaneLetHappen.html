        <div class="Description">
        <p>The wagon travels for what feels like days. Bane sleeps as much as he can, wanting to be
                prepared and well rested for whatever happens. The wagon finally pulls up in front of a 
                small building. He's dragged inside and tossed in a room with another dragonborn,
                this one a female with bronze scales. She glared at him, saying her name was Pax, and
                that he'd better stay out of her way.
        </p>

        <h3>15 Years Later</h3>
        <p>Bane charged at the dummy, cleaving it in half with his sword. It turns out that the 
                place Bane had been brought was a gladiator arena. He's now stuck training for 
                life or death flights, where it's kill or be killed.
        </p>

        <p>Pax comes in, rolling her eyes at him. She pulls out her trident, jabbing it through another
                dummy and throwing it across the room. Despite how she acts Pax has become Bane's 
                bestfriend. They start trading blows, training. Then Teric, the arena master, comes in.
                He says Bane is up for the next fight. Bane sighs, walking out into the arena.
