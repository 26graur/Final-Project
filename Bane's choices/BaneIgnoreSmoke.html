        <p>Bane yawns, laying back down in bed. He drifts off to sleep, sure that it's nothing.

        <p>A few hours later Bane wakes up coughing. His room is engulfed in flames, fire searing his 
                skin. He realizes his terror that his house is on fire, and that he's burning up
                with it.
