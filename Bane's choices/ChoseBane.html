        <div class="Description">
        <p>Bane sat on the steps outside his family's hut, kicking his 7 year old legs through the grass.
                He could see the mayor of his village walking up towards his house. The mayor stopped
                in front of him, telling him to go get his father. Bane nods, running inside calling 
                for his dad. His father, Onxy, came out. He spoke to the mayor for a moment and Bane 
                could see his dad nod. then his dad came back in, telling Bane to go with the mayor 
                since he's going to be in the parade.
        </p>

        <p>Bane goes with the mayor and the mayor has a servant dress him in a fancy outfit for the 
                parade. He's helped into the bed of a wagon and the parade starts. Bane waves happily 
                from the wagon, other villagers waving back.
        </p>

        <p>Suddenly there's a commotion from the woods. Bane turns and sees a hoard of ogres 
                charging out of the woods. The ogres are swinging clubs and roaring.
