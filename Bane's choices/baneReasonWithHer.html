        <div class="Description">
        <p>Bane dodges Pax's attacks, trying to reason with her. She doesn't stop attacking until 
                he mentions her parents, asking if she wants to die in here like they did. She 
                stops attacking, looking up at him. She asks what he means and he explains that 
                he overheard Teric talking about how he'd made sure Pax's parents died in the 
                arena. Pax turns and runs out of the arena.
        </p>

        <p>Later Bane meets Axel outside later, all the gladiators now free. Pax comes out a bit 
                later, covered in blood. Her voice is cold as she says Teric is dead.
