        <div class="Description">
        <p>Bane charges at the centaur, slashing his sword. She dodges around him, swinging her spear 
            in a wide arc. Bane ducks under her spear, slicing through the shaft with his sword. The 
            centaur tries to avoid it, but his sword's slash continues, slicing into her.
        </p>

        <p>After the fight Bane goes out to the gardens, sitting under an oak. he hears footsteps 
            and turns, seeing a half demon walking through the gardens. He hesitates for a moment 
            before heading over, gentally tapping the man on the shoulder. Bane explains what's going 
            on with the arena, how almost none of the gladiators are there voluntarily. The half 
            demon introduces himself as Axel, agreeing to help however Bane needs.
        </p>

        <p>The next day their plan immediatly goes off track. Teric forces Bane and Pax into the arena 
                together, to fight to the death.
