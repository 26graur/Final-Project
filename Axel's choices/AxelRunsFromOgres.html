        <h3>2 Years Pass</h3>

        freedom and trusting him to be on his own. He's walking along the forest edge when
        he suddenly smells smoke. He runs a little ways into the forest and sees a cottage
        on fire. he runs towards it but before he can get to close the cottage explodes, sending him
        flying backwards into the village. The first thing he feels in wind in his hair. Villagers
        are coming twords him, and it's clear they've seen his horns.</p>
