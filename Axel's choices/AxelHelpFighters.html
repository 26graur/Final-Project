        <div class="Description">
        <p>Axel and Bane come up with a plan. Bane's part is mostly to get Pax onboard with escaping.
                Axel on the other hand is supposed to cause a distraction and make a scene so that
                Teric, the arena master, wouldn't be able to stop the fighters from escaping.
        </p>

        <p>The next evening the plan immediatly goes awry. Teric has Pax and Bane in the arena
                together. Pax is fighting Bane, slashing viciously. Bane is holding back, desperatly
                trying to calm her down. Axel is looking around in a panic when he hears Bane roar in 
                pain. Pax had stabbed his side with her trident, throwing him into the opposite
                wall. Axel turns away, running to cause hs distraction.
        </p>

        <p>Chaos ensues as Axel makes the entire arena go dark. He runs to the fighter's barracks
                telling them to leave while they have the chance. Most heed him, running out into freedom.
                Axel follows, hoping Pax and Bane have left as well. When he gets outside he does a
                headcount, seeing that most of the fighters are here. Bane runs up to him saying he has no 
                idea where Pax is. Then they see Pax leaving the building, drenched in blood. She looks 
                over at them, her voice a loud roar as she says Teric is dead.
