        <div class="Description">
        <p>Axel stumbles out of the room into daylight. he can see two guards running towards the 
            building so he turns and bolt, racing into the woods.
        </p>

        <h3>A few months later</h3>

        <p>Axel has figured out that the spell the old man used shattered his soul, that why
            he now has the strange scar. He's started taking on mercenary work, and his most recent
            job is as a body guard for a nobelman. The nobelman takes him to an underground fighting
            ring. Axel can see one of the fighters, a young dragonborn woman with bronze scales. She's
            absolutly ruthless, literally tearing her enemies apart. There's another fightr that stands 
            out to him too, a slightly older dragonborn man with black scales. Unlike the woman this
            dragonborn doesn't drag out the fights, instead ending them as quickly and merifully as 
            possible.
        </p>

        <p>After the fights Axel heads to a nearby garden for a bit. He's surprised to see the male
                dragonborn there. The male dragonborn intoduces himself as Bane, explaining that
                this fighting ring isn't legal. He explains how he was taken he when he was 
                little and forced to fight, forced to kill. Bane contunies explaining, saying
                how the female dragonborn is named Pax and how she's been here her whole life. 
                Axel is stunned. Bane looks down at Axel, asking him if he can help them escape.
