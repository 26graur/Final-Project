        <div class="Description">
        <p>Axel decides to stay with the old man at his inn. The old man teaches him how to properly
                maintain the inn. He also teaches him how to man the bar.
        </p>

        <h3>15 Years Pass</h3>
        <p>The old man passed away, leaving the inn to Axel. Axel is working the bar, serving drinks 
                to customers. He's 26 now, and after 15 years working at the inn he know practially 
                everyone. So he's a bit surprised when a woman he's never met before walks in. She's 
                beautiful, definitely someone he'd remember meeting. She looks over at him, giving
                him a smile. She walks over, asking if he'd like to have a drink with her.</p>
