        <p>Axel sat on the edge of his bed, sighing. He was 9 years old and his mother was being 
                difficult again. She wouldn't let him leave the house without his cloak. Sure 
                he was a half demon, and sure the town hated half demons, and sure today was 
                <strong>LITERALLY</strong> a holiday celebrating a plague that wiped out half demons. 
                But he had friends, surely his friends wouldn't suddenly hate him if they found out 
                what he was. He could just ignore his mom's orders to wear his cloak, surely
                 it'd be fine.</p>
