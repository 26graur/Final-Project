        <h1>Wear the cloak</h1>

        <p>Axel pulls on his cloak, pulling the hood up to hide his horns. He walks outside, looking
        around. he joins his mother on th sidelines of the parade route, taking her hand. 
        The parade starts and he watches the wagonss go by, all of them depicting half demons
        in some form of death and dying. The final wagon comes along, the horse trotting as the 
        young dragonborn on the wagon squirms uncomfortably. </p>
