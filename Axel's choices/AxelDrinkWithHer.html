        <div class="Description">
        <p>Axel nods, grabbing them both a glass. He pours her drink first, then grabs his. He takes a
                sip, then another customer calls him over and he goes to handle it. When he comes back
                he smiles at the woman, taking another drink. He can immediatly tell something's wrong.
                His head feels heavy, his vision blurring. His vison goes black, the woman's face
                the last thing he sees.
        </p>

        <p>Axel blinks awake a bit later, his head aching. He can see the woman from the inn walking
                around, an older man bent over a bench. They notice he's awake, walking over to him.
                The man grabs his chin, murmuring to the woman how she did a good job, how he's a 
                perfect test subject. The man starts to chant, his hands glowing. Axel feels a wave 
                of agony pulse through his chest, like something is being ripped out. Suddenly a glow 
                separates from his form and the man exclaims in joy, shouting that they've finally
                extracted a soul. Suddenly Axel's soul begins to shake, the old man's expression 
                chnaging from joy to fear. There's a bright flash of light and Axel feels as if he's 
                being ripped apart.
        </p>

        <p>When Axel's vision clears he sees the old man and the woman lying dead on the floor. He stands
                up shakily and glances over at a mirror. He can see he has a new scar over his eye, and
                his eyes now seem to be glowing.
